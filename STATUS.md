# Project Status

This document provides the current status of the Domain-SC project, including completed work, work in progress, and planned next steps.

Last updated: May 7, 2025

## Current Phase: Project Reorganization

We are currently in Phase 1.1 of the roadmap, focusing on infrastructure completion and project reorganization.

## Recently Completed

- âœ… Enhanced directory structure with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Improved CLI implementation with better command structure
- âœ… Documentation system setup with MkDocs
- âœ… Development standards defined (linting, typing, testing)
- âœ… GitHub templates for issues and PRs
- âœ… CI workflow configuration with GitHub Actions
- âœ… Roadmap and milestone planning
- âœ… Project tracking documentation
- âœ… Updated GitHub username references

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Testing framework enhancement
- ðŸ”„ Code quality tool configuration
- ðŸ”„ Initial GitHub repository setup

## Next Steps

1. Push code to GitHub repository at github.com/halitipek/Domain-SC
2. Create initial GitHub issues following the INITIAL_ISSUES.md template
3. Configure GitHub Projects board for task tracking
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Configure Read the Docs for documentation hosting

## Overall Progress

| Phase | Progress | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1.1 Infrastructure Completion | 70% | In Progress |
| 1.2 Core Implementation | 0% | Not Started |
| 1.3 Basic Demonstrability | 0% | Not Started |
| 2.1 Algorithm Development | 0% | Not Started |
| 2.2 Data Modeling | 0% | Not Started |
| 2.3 API Specification | 0% | Not Started |

## Key Metrics

- **Test Coverage:** N/A (to be established)
- **Documentation Coverage:** N/A (to be established)
- **Issue Resolution Time:** N/A (to be established)
- **Open Issues:** 0
- **Open Pull Requests:** 0

## Recent Decisions

1. Adopted a clear project structure with separation of concerns
2. Implemented standardized development tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
3. Chosen MkDocs with Material theme for documentation
4. Decided to use GitHub Issues and Projects for tracking development
5. Adopted conventional commits specification for commit messages

## Blockers/Risks

- No major blockers at this time
- Risk: Need to ensure coordination between components during implementation

## Notes

Next project sync is planned after GitHub repository setup is complete to discuss implementation priorities for core functionality.

This status document will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project.
