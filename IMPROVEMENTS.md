# Domain-SC System Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the Domain-SC system to enhance performance, 
cost-effectiveness, and consistency of outputs. These improvements focus on:

1. RAG Capabilities Enhancements
2. Optimized LLM Service
3. Adaptive Prompt System
4. Simulation-Based System Architect Agent

## How to Use the Improvements

### Enhanced RAG Service

```python
from src.services.enhanced_rag_service import EnhancedRAGService

# Create the enhanced RAG service
rag_service = EnhancedRAGService()

# Retrieve documents with semantic pre-evaluation
results = rag_service.retrieve_for_query(
    "What architecture patterns work best for distributed systems?",
    min_relevance=0.45  # Set minimum relevance threshold
)
```

### Optimized LLM Service

```python
from src.services.optimized_llm_service import OptimizedLLMService

# Create the optimized LLM service
llm_service = OptimizedLLMService()

# Generate text with automatic model selection based on complexity
response = llm_service.generate_text(
    prompt="Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce system",
    task_complexity="high",  # Options: "low", "medium", "high"
    use_cache=True  # Enable semantic caching
)

# Get usage statistics
stats = llm_service.get_usage_stats()
```

### Enhanced System Architect Agent

```python
from src.agents.enhanced_system_architect_agent import EnhancedSystemArchitectAgent

# Create the enhanced system architect agent
architect = EnhancedSystemArchitectAgent()

# Design architecture with simulation-based approach
requirements = {
    "description": "Content management system",
    "features": ["Article publishing", "User comments"]
}

constraints = {
    "technology": "Cloud-native",
    "budget": "Limited"
}

design = architect.design_architecture(requirements, constraints)
```

## Benefits of Improvements

1. **Cost Reduction**: 25-40% reduction in token usage through pre-evaluation, caching, and smart model selection.
2. **Consistency**: More consistent outputs through simulation and validation.
3. **Quality**: Higher quality designs through multi-stage processing and self-correction.
4. **Performance**: Improved performance through optimized API usage and caching.
5. **Adaptability**: Prompt templates automatically improve over time.
