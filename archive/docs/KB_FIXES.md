# Knowledge Base Builder Fixes

## Fixed Issues in Enhanced Knowledge Base Builder

This document outlines the fixes made to the knowledge base builder scripts to ensure they function correctly.

### 1. Function Name Consistency

The function `_identify_agent_patterns` was renamed to `_identify_architecture_patterns` to reflect the broader scope of architecture patterns, but some references to the old function name remained. The following lines were updated:

- Line 545: In `_extract_code_blocks` method
- Line 564: In `_extract_code_blocks` method when processing HTML code blocks
- Line 779: In main document processing
- Line 910: In `process_documentation_site` method
- Line 1013: In `process_files` method

### 2. Pattern Dictionary References

The dictionary `AGENT_PATTERNS` was replaced with the more comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS`, but some references to the old dictionary remained. The following lines were updated:

- Line 1143: In `generate_knowledge_report` method for pattern counting
- Line 1180: In `generate_knowledge_report` method for code example counting

### 3. Output Text Updates

Updated all references to "Identified Agent Patterns" to "Identified Architecture Patterns" in output documents:

- Line 787: In file output formatting
- Line 925: In documentation site processing
- Line 1017: In file processing

### 4. Script Execution Permissions

Made both scripts executable for easier use:

- `chmod +x enhanced_knowledge_base.py`
- `chmod +x build_knowledge_base.py`

## Usage

You can now run the enhanced knowledge base builder with:

```bash
./enhanced_knowledge_base.py --discover-resources
```

This will build a comprehensive knowledge base that includes a balanced mix of:
- Multi-agent system patterns
- General architecture patterns
- Design patterns
- API design patterns
- Data, security, scalability, and performance patterns
