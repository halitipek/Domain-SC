## Creating GitHub Milestones

When setting up the GitHub repository, create milestones corresponding to these planned development phases. For each milestone:

1. Use the milestone title as listed above
2. Add the target date
3. Copy the description
4. Create the issues listed in "Issues to Create"
5. Assign appropriate labels and priorities

## Milestone Review Process

At the completion of each milestone:

1. Review all completed issues
2. Document any lessons learned
3. Adjust future milestones if necessary
4. Create a release with detailed release notes
5. Update the roadmap with actual progress

## Notes

- Milestones may be adjusted based on actual progress and feedback
- Issues may be moved between milestones as priorities shift
- Breaking changes should be clearly documented in milestone releases
