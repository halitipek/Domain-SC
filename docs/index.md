# Domain-SC Documentation

Welcome to the Domain-SC documentation. Domain-SC is an AI-powered system architecture design tool that generates detailed software architecture based on requirements.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced RAG Capabilities**: Uses semantic pre-evaluation to filter irrelevant documents
- **Optimized LLM Service**: Smart model selection and semantic caching for efficient processing
- **Adaptive Prompt System**: Performance-tracked prompt templates with versioning
- **Simulation-Based Architecture Design**: Pre-simulates outcomes for better consistency
- **Comprehensive Architecture Generation**: Produces detailed software design documents 

## Getting Started

Follow our [installation guide](guides/installation.md) to set up Domain-SC, then check out the [quick start tutorial](guides/quick-start.md) to generate your first architecture.

## System Overview

Domain-SC uses a multi-agent system with specialized agents that work together to analyze requirements, retrieve relevant architectural patterns, and synthesize appropriate solutions. The system leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and best practices.

For a deeper understanding of how Domain-SC works, see the [system overview](architecture/overview.md) and [workflows documentation](architecture/workflows.md).
