A layered architecture organizes the system into horizontal layers, each with a specific role and responsibility.

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## Event-Driven Architecture

An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.
