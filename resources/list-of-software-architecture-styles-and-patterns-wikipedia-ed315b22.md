From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Software Architecture Pattern** refers to a reusable, proven solution to a recurring problem at the system level, addressing concerns related to the overall structure, component interactions, and quality attributes of the system. Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than [software design patterns](/wiki/Software_design_pattern "Software design pattern"), solving broader system-level challenges. While these patterns typically affect system-level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry. Examples include [Circuit Breaker](/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern "Circuit breaker design pattern"). [[1]](#cite_note-O'Reilly_Media-1)[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)[[3]](#cite_note-:1-3)

**Software Architecture Style** refers to a high-level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions. Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system's properties. These styles represent the most coarse-grained level of system organization. Examples include [Layered Architecture](/wiki/Multitier_architecture "Multitier architecture"), [Microservices](/wiki/Microservices "Microservices"), and [Event-Driven Architecture](/wiki/Event-driven_architecture "Event-driven architecture"). [[1]](#cite_note-O'Reilly_Media-1)[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)[[3]](#cite_note-:1-3)
