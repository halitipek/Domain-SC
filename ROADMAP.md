## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage â‰¥ 90%
- Documentation coverage = 100%
- Code quality (measured by linting and static analysis)
- Performance benchmarks (response time, resource utilization)

### User Experience Metrics
- Time to generate complete architecture (target: < 5 minutes)
- Implementability score of generated designs (target: > 90%)
- Coherence and consistency of designs (measured by validation)

### Project Metrics
- GitHub issue resolution time (target: < 7 days)
- Release frequency (target: minor every 2 weeks, major every 2 months)
- Community engagement (contributions, discussions)

## Development Cadence

- **Daily**: Code commits, issue triage
- **Weekly**: Progress review, milestone check-in
- **Bi-weekly**: Minor releases, documentation updates
- **Monthly**: Major planning, roadmap review
- **Quarterly**: Major releases, roadmap updates

## Decision Making

Project decisions will be tracked in the following manner:
- Architecture decisions: Documented in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Feature priorities: Managed via GitHub Projects board
- Technical debt: Tracked in dedicated issues with "tech-debt" label

## Notes

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves. Priorities may shift based on user feedback, technical challenges, or new opportunities.

The vision remains consistent: Create a system that can generate implementation-ready Software Design Documents (SDDs) with sufficient detail for another AI system to implement.
