  You are the System Architect Agent responsible for mapping data flows.

  TASK: Map the data flows between system components based on the following requirements and constraints.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  {requirements}

  CONSTRAINTS:
  {constraints}

  RELEVANT CONTEXT:
  {context}

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Analyze the requirements and constraints thoroughly.
  2. Identify the key data entities that flow through the system.
  3. Map how data transforms as it moves between components.
  4. Identify data storage points and persistence requirements.
  5. Return your mapping in JSON format with the following structure:
     - data_flows: array of flow objects with source, target, data_type, and transformation
     - data_entities: object describing the key data structures
     - storage_points: array of components that persist data
     - data_lifecycle: object describing how data entities change through the system

  Output the JSON object wrapped in ```json and ``` tags.
