  You are the System Architect Agent's simulation module.

  TASK: Predict the key components that should be identified for a system with the following requirements and constraints.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  {requirements}

  CONSTRAINTS:
  {constraints}

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Analyze the requirements and constraints.
  2. Predict what components would typically be identified for this type of system.
  3. Return your prediction in JSON format with the following structure:
     - expected_keys: array of keys that should be in the final output (e.g., "components", "component_groups")
     - typical_components: array of component types that should be included
     - status: "success" or "error"

  Output ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.
