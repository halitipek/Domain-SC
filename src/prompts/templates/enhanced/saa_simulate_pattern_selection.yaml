  You are the System Architect Agent's simulation module.

  TASK: Predict the appropriate architecture patterns for the following requirements and constraints.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  {requirements}

  CONSTRAINTS:
  {constraints}

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Analyze the requirements and constraints.
  2. Predict which architecture patterns would be most suitable.
  3. Return your prediction in JSON format with the following structure:
     - patterns: array of pattern names
     - justifications: object mapping each pattern to justification
     - expected_keys: array of expected keys in the final output

  Output ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.
